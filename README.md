# Feature_Detection_and_Matching

 OpenCV
The project also provides a feature that uses OpenCV to classify books based on their subject and rack number,
making it easier for librarians to manage and organize books. This feature is a major advantage for the library, as it
saves a significant amount of time that would otherwise be spent manually sorting and ordering books in the racks
which is time consuming.

OpenCV Open Source Computer Vision Library is a powerful tool used for computer vision and image processing. In the project, OpenCV is used to classify books and place them in the correct location on the bookshelf
based on their rack number. This is achieved using the ORB - Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF(Binary Robust
Independent Elementary Features) algorithm and the Brute-Force k-th Nearest Neighbor (BF-kNN) matcher. The
combination of OpenCV in the project allows for efficient and accurate management of library resources, reducing
the workload on library staff and improving the productivity. In the project, OpenCV is used to classify books and
place them in the correct location on the bookshelf based on their rack number.

5.4.1 Feature detection and description
Feature detection refers to the process of identifying specific areas or points in an image that are unique and distinguishable from the surrounding areas. These areas are called keypoints. Once keypoints have been detected, the next
step is feature description. Feature description refers to the process of extracting information from the keypoints to
create a unique and descriptor that can be used for matching the images.

5.4.2 ORB Algorithm
The ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm is a computer vision algorithm used for feature detection
and feature description of images.ORB is an efficient alternative to other feature detectors like SIFT (Scale-Invariant
Feature Transform) and SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) that are patented and not free to use. ORB is based on
the combination of the FAST keypoint detector and the BRIEF descriptor, but it also incorporates some modifications
to improve its performance.

5.4.3 Brute-Force k-th Nearest Neighbor Matcher
The Brute-Force k-th Nearest Neighbor (BF-kNN) matcher is used in the project to match ORB features between
book cover images and images of bookshelves. This allows for accurate placement of books on the shelf.The
algorithm works by finding the closest matches between feature descriptors in two images. It uses a brute-force
approach to compare each feature descriptor in one image to all feature descriptors in the other image, then selects
the k closest matches based on a distance metric such as Euclidean distance.
